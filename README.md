# Pig Game
A simple two-player dice game made with JavaScript, where the objective is to reach 100 points before the other player. This was a course project for "The Complete JavaScript Course" by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.

## Functionality
* Rolling the die adds the number you rolled to your score
* You can choose to either hold your score or roll again
* Holding adds the score you have to your total
* Rolling a one resets your current score and passes the turn over to the other player
* First player to reach 100 wins
